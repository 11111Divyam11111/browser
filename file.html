        <h3>Browser Rendering Engine</h1>
            <p>Built a lightweight HTML/CSS parser and renderer in C++ using custom data structures and stack-based DOM
                tree
                construction, eliminating reliance on external browser engines
            <p> Implemented a CSS styling engine from scratch, supporting selectors, declarations, and properties (e.g.,
                font-size,
                color, text-decoration), applied dynamically to SFML-rendered text.</p>
            <p>Integrated C++ with SFML graphics to render styled content with layout control, viewport scrolling, and
                interactive
                navigation in a custom rendering window.</p>
            <p>Demonstrated low-level parsing and rendering expertise by processing raw input files, constructing a DOM
                + Style
                Tree, and applying styles in a custom rendering pipeline</p>

        <h3>Video Call Application</h3>
        <p>Built a real-time video calling platform using Next.js, socket.io, and simple-peer, supporting features like
            call initia-
            tion, ringing, ongoing call tracking, and call termination.</p>
        <p>Implemented user authentication and management with Clerk Next.js, enabling secure sign-in and sign-up flows
            while managing session state across calls.</p>
        <p> Containerized and deployed the application using Docker and Kubernetes, with multi-replica Deployments,
            Services
            for external access, and environment variable management using Kubernetes Secrets for secure API keys and
            config-
            uration.</p>
        <p>Monitored and validated production pods, ensuring high availability and stability, leveraging Kubernetes logs
            and
            scaling operations while following DevOps best practices</p>
    </div2>
    <div3>
        <h3>Concurrent Web Automation and Systems Integration Engine </h3>
        <p>
            Built a backend-driven automation service using Python, Selenium, and WebDriver, integrating
            environment-based
            configuration via dotenv — mirroring OS-level environment variable management for secure, multi-instance de-
            ployments.</p>
        <p> Applied process synchronization primitives and thread-safe queueing to orchestrate concurrent pipelines,
            ensuring
            deterministic execution within critical sections and eliminating race conditions.</p>
        <p>Implemented event-driven polling loops and timeout-based waits inspired by OS interrupt handling and non-
            blocking I/O, reducing job acceptance latency to under 500ms per cycle.</p>
        <p> Engineered a fault-tolerant process lifecycle manager with intelligent cleanup and state restoration,
            preventing
            browser zombie processes and maintaining >12 hours of continuous runtime stability.
