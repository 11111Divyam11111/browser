    <h1>HTML Parser</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            An HTML parser is a program that reads, analyzes, and converts HTML text into a structured,
            hierarchical format known as the Document Object Model (DOM) tree
            . This process is vital for web browsers, which must transform plain text code into the visual webpages
            users see. Unlike stricter languages like XML, HTML has a very forgiving grammar, which means parsers must
            have robust error-handling to successfully process improperly nested or unclosed tags, a common occurrence
            on the web.
