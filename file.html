    <h1>Hitler : The Lesser Known Facts</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            One lesser-known aspect of Adolf Hitler's life is his extensive use of drugs, especially during his time as
            the Nazi leader. Though he was known to be a vegetarian, a teetotaler, and a nonsmoker, these seemingly
            healthy habits were sharply contrasted by his heavy dependence on various drugs such as opiates,
            methamphetamine, morphine, and even cocaine—administered by his personal physician, Theodor Morell. This
            drug regimen began in 1941 and grew especially intense towards the end of World War II, possibly
            contributing to his physical decline and erratic behavior, including his famously severe tremors, which some
            historians now link more to drug withdrawal than Parkinson's disease. Moreover, Hitler went to great lengths
            to amass a personal fortune—reportedly as much as $5 billion—by siphoning government funds, evading taxes,
            and ordering that millions of copies of his book, Mein Kampf, be purchased as gifts for newlyweds,
            guaranteeing him hefty state royalties. Less commonly mentioned are his multiple health problems, including
            irritable bowel syndrome, and the odd routines imposed on his inner circle, such as forcing staff to remain
            awake with him late into the night while he delivered rambling monologues; he rarely woke before noon. These
            personal eccentricities and secret physical challenges greatly complicated his public image and the inner
            workings of his regime.

            Adolf Hitler had several unusual hobbies that contrasted sharply with his public persona as Nazi Germanys
            dictator. One of his favorite ways to relax was whistling catchy tunes such as “When You Wish Upon a Star,”
            and
            “Whos Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf,” the latter being connected to his personal nickname, “The Wolf.” These
            moments were often seen during times of triumph, like after the fall of Paris, or even while eating during
            the
            stresses of war. He had a deep interest in architecture and opera, spending hours studying blueprints for
            opera
            houses and developing grand plans to rebuild German cities such as Berlin and Linz. Even in wartime, he
            indulged
            in these passions by viewing models of his planned buildings, reflecting his lifelong frustration as a
            failed
            artist and architect.

            Despite his reputation for harshness, Hitler was devoted to his German shepherd, Blondi, who often
            accompanied
            him on walks and hikes in the Alps. He was also quite fond of films and maintained his own private cinema,
            frequently watching British and American movies, including those starring Charlie Chaplin—a peculiar choice
            given the tensions between Nazi Germany and those countries. Surprisingly, before becoming chancellor,
            Hitler
            lived in a modest one-room apartment where he painted daily and supported himself by selling hand-drawn
            postcards in Munich beer halls. He read books on philosophy and science, with Karl Mays Winnetou novels
            remaining a personal favorite well into adulthood.

            Other odd details surround Hitlers personal routines and behavior. He slept in very cold, completely dark
            rooms, and he often forced his close staff members and dinner guests to remain awake well past midnight,
            listening to his lengthy monologues, with little room for debate or dissent. Hitler was also responsible for
            pioneering the creation of blow-up dolls during World War II as part of the “Borghild Project,” which was
            meant
            to prevent soldiers from contracting sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes, though this initiative
            quickly ended due to embarrassment among the troops. All these eclectic interests and habits contributed to
            Hitlers complex legacy as an individual whose personal life was far more peculiar than the historical
            record
            commonly suggests.

            Adolf Hitler’s early life was marked by poverty and failed ambitions. He aspired to be an artist and twice
            applied to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but was rejected both times, with examiners citing his lack of
            emotion in artistic depictions of people. After running out of money in 1909, Hitler lived in homeless
            shelters and men’s dormitories, scraping by on casual labor and by selling postcards and small paintings. He
            spent much time reading in public libraries and observing Viennese society, which fueled his growing
            resentments and shaped his later worldview.

            Hitler’s relationship with health and food was unusual. Though he is often remembered as a strict
            vegetarian, he only adopted the diet fully after 1938, primarily out of fear of disease, not out of
            compassion for animals. Earlier accounts show that he continued to eat meat products into the late 1930s.
            Additionally, Hitler was deeply invested in his public image; he obsessively practiced gestures and
            rehearsed his speeches in front of mirrors, determined to control exactly how he appeared before crowds.

            Many people are surprised to learn that Hitler did not personally visit any concentration camps during his
            rule, and he married Eva Braun only a day before their deaths in April 1945—a highly secretive act, carried
            out in the final hours as Soviet troops were closing in on Berlin. As a matter of personal routine, Hitler
            had an extreme relationship with sleep and sugar—he slept very little and had a particular fondness for
            sweets. Despite his involvement in promoting “Aryan” health, his own health regime involved frequent medical
            treatments and a high dependence on drugs, often seeking stability through dozens of injections and pills
            each day.

            In popular entertainment, Hitler was an enthusiastic film buff, regularly watching American and British
            movies, and was known for binge-watching comedies starring Laurel & Hardy and classics like King Kong and
            Snow White. This eccentric mix of habits and obsessions stands in sharp contrast to the harsh realities of
            his politics and leadership.
